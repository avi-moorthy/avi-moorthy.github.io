I'm a Ph.D. Candidate at Harvard University in Public Policy (Economics Track). My research focuses on labour economics, political economy, and economic history. I promise it's cool!
<br>
At Harvard, I'm a James M. and Cathleen D. Stone PhD Scholar in Inequality and Wealth Concentration. I'm also a PhD affiliate of the Harvard Environmental Economics program (HEEP), the Centre for International Development (CID), and Evidence for Policy Design (EPoD). Prior to Harvard, I grew up in Toronto, Canada, worked as a Research Assistant on the Microeconomics Team at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and graduated from Carleton College in 2018 with a B.A. in Economics <i>(Magna Cum Laude)</i>.
