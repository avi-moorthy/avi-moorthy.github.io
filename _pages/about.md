I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in Public Policy (Economics Track) at Harvard University. I am available for interviews in the 2025â€“2026 job market. My research focuses on labour economics, political economy, and economic history. I promise it's cool!  

At Harvard, I'm a James M. and Cathleen D. Stone Ph.D. Scholar in Inequality and Wealth Concentration. I'm also a Ph.D. Affiliate of the Harvard Environmental Economics Program (HEEP), the Centre for International Development (CID), and Evidence for Policy Design (EPoD).  

Prior to Harvard, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and graduated from Carleton College in 2018 with a B.A. in Economics.  

I'm from Toronto, Canada and am a fan of all things tennis, running, craft breweries, Seinfeld, and Toronto sports.
