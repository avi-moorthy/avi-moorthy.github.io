I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in Public Policy (Economics Track) at Harvard University. My research focuses on labour economics, political economy, and economic history. I promise it's cool!  

At Harvard, I'm a Stone Ph.D. Scholar in Inequality and Wealth Concentration. I'm also an affiliate of the Harvard Environmental Economics Program, Centre for International Development, and Evidence for Policy Design.  

I graduated from Carleton College in 2018 with a B.A. in Economics. Prior to Harvard, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. 

I'm from Toronto, Canada and am a fan of all things tennis, running, craft breweries, Seinfeld, and Toronto sports.   

I am available for interviews in the 2025-2026 job market. You can view my C.V. [here](https://avi-moorthy.github.io/files/Moorthy_CV.pdf).
